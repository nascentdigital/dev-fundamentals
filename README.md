# Dev Fundamentals
A collection of resources, exercises, and challenges on a number of topics to be considered  fundamental knowledge for developers.

## Why

Dev Fundamentals was started at Nascent to foster cross-collaboration between all developers for the purpose of solidifying our understanding of fundamental topics that are important for software development. It is not meant to be a cheat sheet with quick answers and summaries but rather a tool to assist with critical thinking and problem solving while encouraging teamwork. Have a solution? Discuss openly with any dev!

## What

An emphasis will be put on the underlying mechanics of software development.

### Table of Content

- [Session Archive](archive/sessions.md)
- [Topics](topics/)
- [Great Resources](library.md)


## How

A thin and simple format documentation for technical resources, historical archives of dev fundamental sessions, exercises and challenges, and a platform to discuss fundamental topics further. Members can quickly and easily get context on "What, Why & How" for all fundamental dev topics.

A Public Github repository, with Markdown articles as content, (using the repository itself, rather than the "Github Wikis" Feature, this ensures:

- version tracking, and usage of github git gui features 
- publish into a static website using Github Pages
- leverage branch locking and other Github features only available in content repos
