## SORTING

## Challenge:

Study implementations, complexity, and advantage/disadvantages of the following sort algorithms:
+ Insertion Sort (think of how you would sort a deck of cards in your hands)
+ Selection Sort (keep looking for the minimum value)
+ Bubble Sort (iterate while comparing neighbouring values)
+ Merge Sort (split in two)
+ Quick Sort (use a pivot algorithm to determine how to split)

You are given an array of integers. You can assume there are no duplicates.

## Key Points:

+ Space vs Computation Complexity
+ Big O notation 
+ Recursion 

## Further challenges:

List additional related challenges
+ What if you could have duplicate integers?
+ Gnome Sort? ...ask Braini
