## Toolbox Access in O(1)

## Challenge:

Accessing resources in a lookup

Create the data structure that would allow you to access any resource with efficiency, ideally in O(1).


## Key Points:

List key topics covered in session
+ Hash tables
++ key value pairs
++ hashing function
+ Big O notation
++ read performance vs write performance


## Further challenges:

+ What if you need to resize your hash table dynamically?
